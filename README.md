## Introduction

PowerDNS is a powerful DNS server that offers high performance and reliability. This operator simplifies the management of PowerDNS within Kubernetes. With this operator, you can automate the deployment and scaling of PowerDNS instances and manage DNS records efficiently.

## Features

- **Easy Management**: Manage PowerDNS servers and records directly through Kubernetes resources.
- **Automation**: Automatically deploy and configure PowerDNS instances.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale your DNS servers based on demand.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with existing monitoring solutions for better visibility.
- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**: Use CRDs to define your DNS configurations.

## Installation

To install the PowerDNS Operator, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/Aman-singh4699/PowerDNS-Operator/releases). Once downloaded, follow the instructions provided in the release notes to execute the installation.

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.16+)
- kubectl installed and configured
- Helm (optional, for easier management)

## Usage

After installing the PowerDNS Operator, you can start creating DNS resources. Here‚Äôs a basic example to get you started.

### Creating a PowerDNS Instance

1. Create a YAML file named `powerdns.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: operator.powerdns.com/v1alpha1
   kind: PowerDNS
   metadata:
     name: my-powerdns
   spec:
     replicas: 2
     version: "4.5.0"
   ```

2. Apply the configuration:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f powerdns.yaml
   ```

3. Verify the deployment:

   ```bash
   kubectl get powerdns
   ```

### Managing DNS Records

You can also manage DNS records using the operator. Here‚Äôs how to create a DNS record.

1. Create a YAML file named `dnsrecord.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: operator.powerdns.com/v1alpha1
   kind: DNSRecord
   metadata:
     name: my-dns-record
   spec:
     zone: example.com
     name: www
     type: A
     ttl: 300
     records:
       - 192.0.2.1
   ```

2. Apply the configuration:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f dnsrecord.yaml
   ```

3. Verify the DNS record:

   ```bash
   kubectl get dnsrecord
   ```

## Configuration

The PowerDNS Operator allows for various configurations. You can set parameters such as the number of replicas, version, and more. Here‚Äôs an example of a more detailed configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.powerdns.com/v1alpha1
kind: PowerDNS
metadata:
  name: my-powerdns
spec:
  replicas: 3
  version: "4.5.0"
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "128Mi"
    limits:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "512Mi"
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
```
